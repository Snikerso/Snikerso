Hello,

I am someone who constantly hears, "You're always starting something new." Some see it as a flaw, but you know what? I don't see it that way at all, and I'm proud of it because my goal for my life is bigâ€”but I won't reveal it to you. It's big and requires skills and knowledge from many fields like IT, cognitive science, biology. I don't actually need to be an expert in everything down to the smallest detail; that's old-fashioned, school thinking. I learn things that I need at the moment and solve small problems. Even if I were to spend my whole life learning programming, I still wouldn't learn everything. I prefer to take things step by step and find satisfaction in each step. This path gives me the most joy and satisfaction. It's my path of small steps.
